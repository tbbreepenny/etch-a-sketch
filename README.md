## Interactive Grid Drawing
This is a simple web application that allows users to interact with a grid of squares. Each square can be hovered over to change its color, and the color progressively darkens with each interaction until it becomes fully black.

## Features:
Random Initial Colors: Each square in the grid starts with a random RGB color.
Progressive Darkening: Each time you hover over a square, its color darkens by 10%. After 10 interactions, the square becomes completely black.
Resizable Grid: The user can create a new grid with a customizable number of squares per side (up to 100x100).

## Technologies Used:
HTML5
CSS3 (Flexbox)
JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Use:
Open the index.html file in your browser.
A grid of 16x16 squares will appear.
Hover over any square to change its color. Each hover will darken the square by 10% until it becomes completely black.
To create a new grid, click the "Create New Grid" button, and enter the number of squares per side (max 100). The new grid will be generated with the same total area (960px).
